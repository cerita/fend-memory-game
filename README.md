#Let's Play A Game
Based on the classic game Concentration, the game board has 6 pairs of cards all showing face down. 
Click on a card to flip it over and reveal the symbol on the front. Then, click on a second card to see if the symbols match. If they match, the cards will turn green. If not, they'll flip back over. Keep trying to make pairs until all 6 are found.  

Be careful: The more moves you make, the lower your rating!
